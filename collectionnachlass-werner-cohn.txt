Nachlass Werner Cohn The fund can be counted among what are recently considered the archives of exile: after being forced to leave Germany for racial reasons Cohn decided to remain in Florence even after 1938 (racial laws in Italy). After the Second World War he had relations with Federico Zeri and the most important Italian Art Historians. The Cohn Fund has recently been consulted by the staff of the Heidelberg Museum of Anthropology, who has published the photo of one of our documents, and has been the subject of two other researches, always German, aimed at reconstructing the events of a collection of works of which traces were lost during Nazi-fascism (Provenance Research).
